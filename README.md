# Association Rule

- Association rule learning is a type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item and maps accordingly so that it can be more profitable.
- Association rules are "if-then" statements, that help to show the probability of relationships between data items, within large data sets in various types of databases.

    For Ex:  Itemset={ Bread, Egg, Milk } = [    {Bread, Egg}(Antecedent) --> {Milk}(Consequent)    ]
- It tries to find some interesting relations or associations among the variables of dataset. It is based on different rules to discover the interesting relations between variables in the database.
